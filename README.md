# Wavesculpter

An experimental audio playground, built in Unity. Intended to be motion-controlled
by the TapStrap 2 peripheral.

NOTE: The code depends on an audio asset that I have not uploaded to GitHub, as I
don't own the rights to the sample that I've been using for testing, and I didn't
put effort into finding free audio.

Currently supports the following features:

* Tap with pointer finger to increase volume, tap with middle finger to decrease volume
* Tap with ring finger to play, tap with pinky finger to pause
* Tap with pointer and middle finger to increase pitch, tap with ring and pinky finger to decrease pitch
* Tap with thumb and pinky finger to increase distortion, tap with pointer/middle/ring finger to decrease distortion
